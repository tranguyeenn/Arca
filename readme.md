# Arca

Arca is a web-based study platform that helps students retain knowledge long-term by converting learning materials into structured content and scheduling reviews using spaced repetition.

The goal of Arca is to remove the friction from studying by automating content organization, review timing, and progress tracking.

## What Arca Does

Arca supports a complete study loop:

1. Users upload learning materials (e.g. PDFs, slides)
2. Arca extracts key concepts and generates review questions
3. Questions are scheduled using adaptive spaced repetition
4. Users review questions that are due
5. Review performance updates future scheduling

The system decides **what to study and when**, so users can focus on learning instead of planning.
